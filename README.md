# Three example variant classifications (ACMG)


### Variant 1: BRCA1 c.68_69delAG (p.Glu23ValfsTer17)

**Disease**: Hereditary Breast-Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC)

**Variant Type**: Frameshift deletion (2 nucleotide deletion in exon 2)

**Clinical Significance**: This frameshift variant deletes two nucleotides from the BRCA1 coding sequence, causing a reading frame shift that produces a premature termination codon 17 amino acids downstream. The resulting truncated protein represents a loss-of-function event.[^1]

**ACMG Classification: PATHOGENIC**

| ACMG Criterion | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **PVS1** (Very Strong) | Frameshift variant in exon 2 causing premature stop codon leading to predicted loss of function; the protein terminates at codon 40 instead of the normal 1863, eliminating critical domains including the RING finger domain and BRCT repeats essential for DNA repair[^1]. In a Bayesian framework, PVS1 alone represents extremely strong evidence[^2]. |
| **PM2** (Moderate) | The variant is absent or appears at extremely low frequency in population databases (gnomAD: 0.0014%, representing 58/282,442 alleles)[^1]. This rarity supports pathogenicity by demonstrating the variant is not tolerated in the general population. |
| **PS4** (Strong) | This variant is significantly more prevalent in affected individuals than controls; it is a well-established founder mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish populations where it accounts for approximately 30% of early-onset breast cancers[^1]. Population association data strongly support disease causation. |
| **PP5** (Supporting) | Multiple reputable sources, including the ClinGen-approved ENIGMA expert panel, have established this as pathogenic, with strong clinical evidence from numerous affected families[^1]. |

**Combining Rule Application**: According to ACMG guidelines, a single **very strong (PVS1)** criterion alone meets the threshold for pathogenic classification. The additional moderate, strong, and supporting evidence further solidifies this determination.[^3]

### Variant 2: PKP2 c.2443_2448delAACACCinsGAAA (frameshift)

**Disease**: Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM)

**Variant Type**: Frameshift indel (deletion of 6 bp with insertion of 4 bp) in exon 12

**Clinical Significance**: This complex indel in the plakophilin-2 gene introduces a frameshift mutation that changes the reading frame and produces an aberrant mRNA subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Plakophilin-2 is a critical desmosomal protein linking desmosomal cadherins to intermediate filaments and the sarcomere. Its loss leads to progressive cardiomyocyte junction weakening, fibrotic remodeling, and arrhythmogenesis.[^4]

**ACMG Classification: PATHOGENIC**

| ACMG Criterion | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **PVS1** (Very Strong) | Frameshift variant in exon 12 producing truncated or absent protein through the nonsense-mediated decay pathway[^4]. The protein is predicted to be severely dysfunctional or completely absent, representing a clear loss-of-function mechanism known to cause ACM[^4]. |
| **PM2** (Moderate) | The variant is absent from gnomAD (v.4.1) and ClinVar databases, indicating it is extremely rare or unreported in population cohorts[^4]. This absence in control populations supports pathogenicity. |
| **PP1** (Supporting) | Cosegregation with disease across multiple affected family members: the variant was detected in symptomatic probands and segregated with ACM presentation across two independent families[^4]. All carriers with the variant showed disease manifestations, while non-carriers remained asymptomatic. |

**Functional Supporting Evidence**: Beyond ACMG criteria, functional studies using peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated that variant carriers had 48% reduced PKP2 gene expression compared to wild-type controls (p = 0.00015), providing PS3 (strong functional evidence) support.[^4]

**Combining Rule Application**: **PVS1 (Very Strong) + PM2 (Moderate) = Pathogenic**. According to updated ACMG combining rules and the Bayesian framework, this combination meets the criterion for pathogenic classification with posterior probability >0.99. The additional PP1 evidence strengthens the conclusion.[^3]

### Variant 3: LMNA c.1824C>T (p.Tyr608Cys, creating altered termination)

**Disease**: Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS)

**Variant Type**: Missense variant that creates an altered splicing pattern producing truncated lamin A protein

**Clinical Significance**: This de novo variant causes approximately 90% of classic Hutchinson-Gilford progeria cases. The variant does not create a simple missense substitution but instead triggers alternative splicing that produces an abnormal truncated protein designated LA∆50 (lamin A delta-50). This protein accumulates intracellularly and causes dominant-negative effects, disrupting nuclear morphology and gene regulation.[^5]

**ACMG Classification: PATHOGENIC**

| ACMG Criterion | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **PS3** (Strong) | Comprehensive functional studies demonstrate that c.1824C>T causes production of abnormal truncated lamin A protein (LAΔ50) with severe deleterious effects[^5]. Studies show the protein causes: (1) altered nuclear morphology with lobulation and thickening of the nuclear lamina, (2) loss of peripheral heterochromatin, (3) clustering of nuclear pores, and (4) progressive accumulation of the abnormal protein during cellular aging[^5]. Cell transfection experiments prove that LAΔ50 induces the same nuclear abnormalities when introduced into normal cells, establishing causality. |
| **PM2** (Moderate) | This is a de novo variant absent from population databases (not observed in gnomAD or general population controls)[^5]. The de novo origin combined with absence in controls strongly supports pathogenicity. |
| **PS4** (Strong) | Markedly higher prevalence in affected individuals: approximately 90% of classic HGPS cases carry c.1824C>T[^5]. This extraordinarily high association in affected individuals versus absence in healthy controls provides strong evidence for pathogenicity. |
| **PP4** (Supporting) | Multifactorial clinical evidence: patients presenting with progeria phenotype and this genotype show complete phenotypic concordance, including failure to thrive, alopecia, prominent scalp veins, and accelerated aging[^5]. The clinical picture precisely matches the expected HGPS presentation. |

**Mechanistic Understanding**: The pathogenic mechanism involves a dominant-negative effect rather than simple haploinsufficiency. The abnormal LAΔ50 protein interferes with wild-type lamin A function, disrupting nuclear architecture and inducing premature aging at the molecular level—a recapitulation of normal aging mechanisms.[^5]

**Combining Rule Application**: **PS3 (Strong) + PM2 (Moderate) = Likely Pathogenic**. However, the additional **PS4 (Strong)** criterion strengthens this to **Pathogenic** classification. The combination of two strong criteria (PS3, PS4) plus moderate (PM2) exceeds the threshold for pathogenic with very high confidence.[^3]
